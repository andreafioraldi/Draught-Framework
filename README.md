# Draught-Framework
is a software framework composed by three core component:
+ Dubbel, a run-time environment with its bytecode and its assembly
+ Stout, an untyped programming language that is compiled to Dubbel bytecode
+ IPA, a set of class libraries that can be loaded from the Dubbel Virtual Machine

Dubbel is composed by a virtual machine, an assembler and a disassembler.
It also has a module called Dubbel Builder, a library designed to simplify the creation of compilers that target the dubbel bytecode.

Stout come with a compiler and a shell.
